# Typo3-Umlaut-Finder
Older versions of Typo3 have problems with files that contain an german Umlaut.
If being hosted on a Windows platform this script searches for any file containing an Umlaut and lists them including owner of the file for blaming and shaming.
jk just update the fucking typo3

## Usage
```
.\List-Umlaut.ps1 -Path %ROOTPATH%
```
